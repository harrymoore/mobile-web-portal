			</p>
			<p>About Probability Illustrations, Limitations, and Key Assumptions</p>
			<p>The probability illustrations OnTrack® generates are based on "Monte Carlo" simulations of 500 possible investment scenarios for a given time period, and assume a range of possible returns. The illustrations are generated according to models developed by Ibbotson Associates, a leading independent provider of asset allocation, analytical and wealth forecasting software. The "retirement outlook" graphic reflects the difference between the model's estimated annual income (an amount that corresponds to a 70% probability of achieving your income goal in the investment scenarios simulated) and your annual income goal.</p>

			<p>To forecast the probability of achieving your income goal, the model considers historical performance and other information for selected investment asset classes using all available and relevant data (from 1926 and 1970 forward for equity and fixed income, respectively), as represented by the common benchmark indexes noted below::
				<ul>
					<li>Cash: Citigroup 3-Month Treasury Bill
					</li><li>Short-Term Bonds: Barclays U.S. Treasury 1-3yr Term Index
					</li><li>Aggregate Bonds: Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index
					</li><li>Long-Term Bonds: Barclays Capital U.S. Long Credit A Index
					</li><li>High-Yield Bonds: Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate High Yield Index
					</li><li>TIPS: Barclays Capital U.S. Treasury: U.S. TIPS
					</li><li>International Bonds: Citigroup WGBI
					</li><li>Large-Cap Stocks: Russell 1000® Index
					</li><li>Mid-Cap Stocks: Russell Midcap Index
					</li><li>Small/Mid-Cap Stocks: Russell 2500® Index
					</li><li>Small-Cap Stocks: Russell 2000® Index
					</li><li>REITS:  FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs
					</li><li>International Stocks: MSCI EAFE Index
					</li><li>Emerging Markets: MSCI Emerging Markets Index
					</li>Commodities: DJ-UBSCISM
				</ul>
			The model does not consider other asset classes such as hedge funds or private equity, which may have characteristics similar or superior to those used in the model.
			</p>
			<p>Unless you choose otherwise or your employer supplies different information, the probability illustrations assume retirement at the age at which you qualify for full Social Security benefits and an annual retirement income goal of 80% of your projected final working salary. Social Security estimates are based on the Social Security Administration methodology and your current salary. The probability illustrations also assume a consistent contribution percentage and asset allocation (no future changes or rebalancing), annual inflation of approximately 2%, and annual salary increases based on a calculation that incorporates multiple factors including a salary growth curve and inflation. Mortality assumptions are based on the Society of Actuaries tables.
			The models are subject to a number of limitations. Returns associated with market extremes may occur more frequently than assumed in the models. Some asset classes have relatively limited histories; for these classes the models use historical data for shorter time periods.<p>

			<p>There is no guarantee that your income goal will be achieved or that the aggregate accumulated amount will ensure a specified annual retirement income. Also, the model results may vary with each use of OnTrack and over time.
			IMPORTANT: The projections generated by the simulation model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical, do not reflect actual investment results, and do not guarantee future results. Moreover, even though OnTrack's estimates are statistically sound based upon the simulations it runs, the tool cannot foresee or account for every possible scenario that may negatively impact your financial situation. Thus you should monitor your account regularly and base your investment decisions on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and personal financial situation, as well as on the information in the prospectuses for investments you consider.</p>
